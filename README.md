# r4rimporter
Resources for Researchers Prototype Importer

# Configuration Information
The configuration file is based on the https://github.com/NCIOCPL/loader-pipeline library.  For the R4R Loader we have implemented the following pipeline steps:
## Source 
* **GithubResourceSource** - This class pulls the content from a Github Repository 
  * Input: N/A
  * Output: This returns an array of the *fetched* documents in git.
  * Configuration:
    * `repoUrl` : (required) The git repo where the content resides.
    * `resourcesPath`: (required) The path within the repo to the resources.
    * `branchName` : (default: master) The branch to use.
    * `authentication` : (optional) Git authentication configuration. See https://github.com/octokit/rest.js#authentication for options, but token authentication is what has been tested. If no authentication is defined, then the source will use the public API, which has IP source address limits.   
## Transformers:
* **NetlifyMDResourceTransformer** - Transforms documents in Markdown with YML Front-matter format conforming to the r4r-content schema (https://github.com/NCIOCPL/r4r-content/blob/master/admin/config.yml) the  
  * Input: An array of documents that follow the r4r-content schema
  * Output: A single record in a format expected by the ElasticResourceLoader
  * Configuration:
    * `mappingUrls` - (required) An object that contains the following properties:
      * `docs` - (required) The URL to the docs taxonomy
      * `researchAreas` - (required) The URL to the research areas taxonomy
      * `researchTypes` - (required) The URL to the research types taxonomy
      * `toolTypes` - (required) The URL to the tool types taxonomy
## Loader:
* **ElasticResourceLoader** - Loads all records into an Elasticsearch index matching the format of \<aliasName\>\_YYYYMMDD\_HHMMSS. Upon successful completion
  * Input: Documents in a format matching the elasticsearch mapping
  * Output: N/A
  * Configuration:
    * eshosts - (required) An array of elasticsearch host URIs. This should include the protocal, username (if needed), password (if needed), port.
    * daysToKeep - (required) The number of days to keep indices for
    * aliasName - (required) The Elasticsearch alias for the most recent index. This is also the prefix for the timestamped index
    * mappingPath - (required) The index mapping configuration in JSON
    * settingsPath - (required) The index settings configuration in JSON.
  

Prerequisites: node 8

# Setup for Development
1. Install Jest globally
`npm install -g jest`
2. Setup local
`npm install`
3. For VSCode development
   1. Install Coverage Gutters extension
   2. Install Jest extension
4. Setup a local configuration
   1. create a local.json file in the <importer_root>/config directory
   2. This file is used to override the default.json options and should look something like:
```
{
    "logging": {
        "level": "debug"
    },
    "pipeline": {
        "source": {
            "module": "./lib/sources/github-resource-source",
            "config": {
                "repoUrl": "https://github.com/nciocpl/r4rcontent",
                "resourcesPath": "/resources",
                "branchName": "<YOUR_BRANCH>",
                "authentication": {
                    "type": "token",
                    "token": "<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>"
                }
            }
        },
        "loader": {
            "module": "lib/loaders/elastic-resource-loader",
            "config": {
               "eshosts": [ "<THE REAL DEV SERVER>" ],
               //"eshosts": [ "http://localhost:9200" ],
               "daysToKeep": 10,
               "aliasName": "r4r_v1",
               "mappingPath": "es-mappings/mappings.json",
               "settingsPath": "es-mappings/settings.json"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
